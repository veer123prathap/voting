Grafana on AWS, you have two primary options: managed Grafana from AWS or self-hosting on an EC2 instance.

Managed Grafana (Grafana Cloud)

Pricing: Per-user billing based on chosen plan (Free, Standard, or Enterprise).
Key features:
Simplified setup and management.
Pre-built and curated dashboards for common AWS services.
Seamless integration with AWS CloudWatch and other AWS services.
Scalability and high availability.
Access control and user management.
Considerations:
Potential cost if you have many users.
Less customization compared to self-hosting.
Vendor lock-in to some extent.
Self-Hosting Grafana on EC2

Pricing: No per-user fees, only the cost of running an EC2 instance and additional resources.
Key features:
Full control and customization over Grafana configuration.
Integrates with any data source, including CloudWatch and external sources.
Can be integrated with your existing infrastructure and security policies.
Considerations:
Requires manual setup and management.
Additional infrastructure costs may arise.
Security and availability require careful planning and implementation.
Choosing the Right Option for You:

The best option for you depends on your specific needs and priorities:

Managed Grafana is ideal if:
You have a small number of users.
You need quick and easy setup and management.
You value integration with AWS services and pre-built dashboards.
Cost is not a major concern.
Self-hosting on EC2 is ideal if:
You have a large number of users.
You need maximum control and customization.
You have existing infrastructure and security policies to integrate with.
You are comfortable with manual setup and management.
Additional Considerations:

Scalability: Managed Grafana can automatically scale with your needs, while self-hosting requires manual scaling or infrastructure optimization.
Security: Implement robust security measures on your EC2 instance and data sources if self-hosting.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring of your Grafana instance, whether self-hosted or managed, for uptime and performance insights.
